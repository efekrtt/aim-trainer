Aim Trainer with Pygame

This aim trainer is a simple game built using Pygame, a popular Python library for creating 2D games. The aim of this trainer is to help improve your aim and reflexes by shooting at moving targets.
Features

    Multiple difficulty levels: The game offers different difficulty levels to cater to players of various skill levels. You can choose between easy, medium, and hard modes to challenge yourself accordingly.

    Moving targets: The game generates random moving targets that you must shoot to earn points. The targets move at varying speeds and directions to provide a dynamic and challenging experience.

    Score tracking: Your score is displayed on the screen, allowing you to track your progress and aim for higher scores. The aim trainer keeps track of your score throughout the game session.

    Timer: The game also includes a timer that starts when you begin playing. This adds an element of urgency and encourages you to react quickly to hit the targets within the given time limit.
